###Description
> This project displays a random password generated from a hardcoded String array.  It randomly concatenates a symbol to each randomly chosen string, and then gives the user an option to concatenate another number and/or symbol to the very end.  
> If user fails to enter in a number, the password field reminds them to enter a value greater than 0.
>Used Bootstrap framework admittedly without really knowing what I was doing.. but it's there.  Will look into it more for future projects!
###Demo Information
> Will be demo'd through Jing.
###Details
> When the page loads, it will ask you to fill out the information.  Upon successfully filling it out, it will return a password to the password field at the top. If you fail to enter a number, or if the number is 0 or a character (i.e. not an integer > 0, it will ask you to input an integer larger than 0. 
###Plugins or Outside Libraries Used
> Bootstrap framework was used.  http://getbootstrap.com/
