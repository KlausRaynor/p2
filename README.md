###Description
> This project displays a random password generated from a hardcoded String array.  It randomly concatenates a symbol to each randomly chosen string, and then gives the user an option to concatenate another number and/or symbol to the very end.  
> If user fails to enter in a number, the password field reminds them to enter a value greater than 0.
>Used Bootstrap framework admittedly without really knowing what I was doing.. but it's there.  Will look into it more for future projects!
###Demo Information
